## Purpose
The purpose of the site is to simnplify how and improve upon how Professors <br />
and Students plan and make their schedules for classes. Cunyfirst is clunky and<br />
unoptimized. We want to streamline the experience especially when it comes to devices<br />
that are not desktops.

## Resources and Technology used
- Figma
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS

## Front-end
Bootstrap was used to make a website that dyanmically changed with screen size <br />
Figma was used for the visual design

## Back-end

## Database management system
Mongodb Atlas was used for the database.

## Differences
The login page new user and forgot password pages stayed pretty similar to the original visual design.<br />
The other pages were brought more in line with the design cues of the previous three pages.
